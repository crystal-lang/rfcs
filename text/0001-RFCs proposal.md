- Feature Name: rfcs_proposal
- Start Date: 2024-01-30
- RFC PR: [crystal-lang/rfcs#0001](https://github.com/crystal-lang/rfcs/pull/0001)
- Issue: N/A

# Summary

Following the work of Rust, we're proposing to follow a similar guide to create and discuss RFCs.

# Motivation

RFCs written in an issue in the main repo do not have a good way to be discussed. Instead, a markdown file in a PR in GitHub benefits from the commenting tools available.

# Reference-level explanation

Check the [README](../README.md) for details.

# Prior art

We're following [Rust's process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).
