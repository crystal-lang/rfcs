# Summary

Following the work of Rust, we're proposing to follow a similar guide to create and discuss RFCs.

# Motivation

RFCs written in an issue in the main repo do not have a good way to be discussed. Instead, a markdown file in a PR in GitHub benefits from the commenting tools available.

# Reference-level explanation

Check the [README](../README.md) for details.

# Prior art

We're following [Rust's process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).
